Most papers in the McHenry Lab are constructed in the following order:

1. **Construct a first draft of the figures.** The intent here is to envision a narrative for the project that (1) explains the methods, (2) illustrates the data analysis, and (3) demonstrates the major findings. 
2. **Compose the Methods.** Once it is clear what data need to be included to support the paper's narrative, then the methods can be written.
3. **Write the Results.** This step requires confidence in what figures and statistics that will be included in the final paper. 
4. **Draft the Introduction and Discussion.** The Discussion is usually easier to start with, because the text should flow from what is written in Results. However, as the literature is brought into the writing process, it often makes sense to draft up the Introduction as well. There is no harm in developing these sections together.
5. **Start the abstract**. It's a good idea to create the first draft of the abstract once the structure of the Intro and Discussion is apparent. This is because the abstract will need many stages of refinement. Its concise format can also be helpful for guiding the writing on those more lengthy sections.
6. **Revise, revise, revise.** It's best to assume that numerous revision cycles will be required to arrive at a publication-quality manuscript. It is common when writing one section to reveal shortcomings in other sections. So, after drafting the entire paper on the first pass, you will generally revisit all sections and the figures and not necessarily in order.

There are many tips and guidelines for the composition of each section of a paper. More details to come . . .
