Guides for the practice of science


## Software

 - [Getting started with Python](Python.md). We have primarily used Python for tasks related to the running of experiments and the acquisition of kinematic data from video recordings. However, the diversity of packages available to Python mean that it could be applied to really any stage in data analysis and visualization.
 - [Getting started with Blender](Blender.md). Blender hasn't gotten much traction in the lab yet, but could be useful for CFD models or perhaps mere animations of data in the future.
