## Coding for data acquisition and analysis

 - [Getting started with Python](Python.md). We have primarily used Python for tasks related to the running of experiments and the acquisition of kinematic data from video recordings. However, the diversity of packages available to Python mean that it could be applied to really any stage in data analysis and visualization. Not as easy to get started with as Matlab.
 - [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) has been our workhorse for data analysis for years. It is relatively easy to install and start using and the licensing has gotten easier to manage over the years. It is popular with engineers, which is helpful for collaboration. 
 - R is probably the most popular programming language among biologists and it has extensive packages for stats, data analysis, and visualization.  [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is an IDE that has many similarities to Matlab and VS Code and so is not a difficult transition for users of those environments.  Some of our projects have started to use R for the final stages of data analysis for statistics and visualization. 
 - Large-language-models. [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com) and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) are helpful references for coding and capable of formulating extensive code upon request. However, these resources should be used with caution.  It is easy to get over your skis and generate code that you do not understand, which makes it difficult to troubleshoot and verify the accuracy of its results.

## Software list

- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) for literature library management. After years of ambivalence about this category of software, I now strongly advocate this choice. It is better than Mendeley (and has better privacy protection) on web browser integration, allows for easy sharing of libraries, has a nice iPad app (with annotation ability), and a reasonably-priced plan for cloud integration. It offers support for plug-ins and I make regular use of [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/).  
- [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) for web browsing. Vivaldi is essentially a more customizable version of Google Chrome. I like it's use of workspaces for pickup us from where I left off on a certain area of work (e.g., coding, writing, service, teaching). 
- [Slack](https://slack.com) for work communication.

## Publishing

- [Making figures](figures.md). 
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project). Website that functions like Google Docs for Latex documents. In addition to features like Track Changes and the ability for multiple authors to work simultaneously, Overleaf has a robust Latex interpreter that will render a pdf in spite of errors that trips up other software. This also is probably the easiest way to start using Latex, with helpful [documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn).

## Other

 - [Getting started with Blender](Blender.md). Blender hasn't gotten much traction in the lab yet, but could be useful for CFD models or perhaps mere animations of data in the future.
